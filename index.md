Hello my name is Iain Donn and welcome to my blog The life and times of a lonely coder.
Introduction

As far as we know computer programmers are humans writing code to input human attributes into AI which inturn creates a synthetic
human reognisable interface which presents as human as possibly can. So whos writing our code,well to even understand Programmers
we need to understand the human psychology behaves behind the activity.

My blog aims to show a social experiment where programmers are asked how they know what they know not how they do it, this may 
seem like a boring lecture on self coding but it draws upon how we percieve and undertand why we need to code and programme. This was studied to
find out the link between individual mastery and organisational success, where the two main influences are reputation and recoginition and money.
from an organisational view point its clear through the "bergman theory" this demonstrates different aspects of coginitive functions that allow us 
to manage our workload but also provides a look into stress managment and co dependancy on our most favoured hero caffine.
and how they are applied in the workplace.



Hi, iain here i have been in the creative industry for around 8 years and delved into social care to seek my true hero, however dark and deep this career was
it helped me learn resilaince and coping strategies to deal with the we shall not speak of this, "mental health". I then had a family and oh boy did that change my life, WOW i cant even begin to explain the slow burning death of sleep regressions, potty training and sleep training ect.
i then decided oh i'll try and change my career and was introduced to the realm of coding, python, SQL, Javascript the list is endless, and which point i am at now
youve probably guessed by my github blog pages project, yes at the beginning.

My blog is merley an insight into the psychology of coders and how we maintain our cool calm demeanur in the face of overwork lord and debugging code to prevail
victorius while staving off insomnia and sleep. I get it we love sitting debugging, writing code and drinking copius amounts of the good stuff but how did we get here,
what provided us with the knowledge of coding practices. this is what my blog will try to explain.
