## The life and times of a lonely coder

Learn about the psychology of computer programmers with an 80s hook.

Delve deeper into the dark lines blended between a programmers 
subconcious and experience the human condition inputed by our very own source code!

The future they say is AI who's coding these substructures of artificial intelignce programmers? or scientists?
jump into my discussion on this curious topic and find out what really is making society want this to advance
and why its being implimented without underdstanding the costs of our own creations.

### AI - what actually are we hoping to achieve.

Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.

In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.

AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.

Lets delve into the world of AI.

So programmers have the coginitive skills to learn how an AI will behave by simply writing its source code, inputing reasoning attributes and values as well as human
principles, emotions, regulation and problem solving here is self correction, now think about how an AI could solve a problem that would take us years to understand
how to solve it then bare the feelings of ill will against a machine code because it got there first, well arent we being a little bit selfish and self centered there after all we created this form of artificial intelegince to do the things we cant, " calling the kettle black" arent we.

And this is where we are at an ethical crossroads, how do we safley and reasonably justify the sole existence of this AI, its capabilities and its unssen vast knowledge base well we first have to deal with our ethics on human cognitive behaviour before we can adapt to trusting an artifiical machine that swears its human?
this is the point we have got to where https://www.carnegiecouncil.org/initiatives-issues/artificial-intelligence-and-equality?gclid=Cj0KCQiA6LyfBhC3ARIsAG4gkF9NpzG7FIMr4YGlJDvbxyI4FhjbAkJApLM4YX498d8R8rHV_rT__7saAkiOEALw_wcB
have stepped in and created the first Artificial Intelligence equality initiative where they have substructured the tools to understand and accept the limitations we set not AI?

The Artificial Intelligence & Equality Initiative seeks to:

Build: Build the foundation for an inclusive dialogue—an Agora—to probe issues related to the benefits, risks, tradeoffs, and tensions that AI fosters.

Nurture: Nurture an interdisciplinary, intergenerational community of practice to rapidly address urgent challenges in the uses of AI and other novel technologies.

Establish: Establish a forum for those in positions where they must make considered choices and decisions about the development and deployment of AI applications.

Forge: Forge transparent, cross-disciplinary, and inclusive conversations and guided inquiries.

Empower: Empower ethics as a tool for making thoughtful decisions about embedding AI systems and applications in the fabric of daily life.

so its not what we all fear and think that one day our very own creation will dominate us and empower us as slaves to do their bidding, no far from the sci fi scenrio we are actually arriving into a new era of change within our technoloigal age and we are attempting to push the boundaries whilst maintaning our ethical codes.

What may this new era hold for us well we are the ones in controll of the code and langauge structure so what can we aim to achieve time will tell.


Many thanks for reading my short and first ever blog.
